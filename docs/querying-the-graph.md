## Querying the Graph

For the graphrag-toolkit, the primary unit of context presented to the LLM is the *statement*, which is a standalone assertion or proposition. Source documents are broken into chunks, and from these chunks are extracted statements. In the [graph model](./graph-model.md), statements are thematically grouped by topic, and supported by facts. At question-answering time, the graphrag-toolkit retrieves groups of statements, and presents them in the context window to the LLM.

The graphrag-toolkit contains two different retrievers: a `TraversalBasedRetriever`, and a `VectorGuidedRetriever`. The `TraversalBasedRetriever` uses a combination of 'top down' search – finding chunks through vector similarity search, and then traversing from these chunks through topics to statements and facts – and 'bottom up' search, which performs keyword-based lookups of entities, and proceeds through facts to statements and topics. The `VectorGuidedRetriever`... TODO
